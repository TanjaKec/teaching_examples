## Welcome!

Hey math boffins, welcome to the coding with R class! Let me introduce you to our team:

![](images/instructors.png)

- Hi, I'm Di! A professor at Monash University, and originally from Wauchope, NSW. 
- This is Earo! She's a PhD student in econometrics and business statistics at Monash University, an expert in methods for temporal data. 
- This is Nick! He's a post-doctoral researcher in econometrics and business statistics at Monash University, and has an R package called naniar.

### Exercise 

*Introduce yourself to the other members of your team, and brainstorm a team name. You've got five minutes!* 

*Nominate a spokesperson to give a 1 minute intro for the team to us all.*

## Let's get started learning R! 

- *Login to your computer.* 
- *Open RStudio, using `Start -> All Programs`*
- *Create a project for your work. On the very right side of the window is a small blue R, and a drop down menu. Select `New project`, then `New directory`, navigate to the desktop, and name the project `ChooseMATH`. This will create a folder with this name on the desktop. This will be our workspace for the day.*

```{r fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio.png")
```

## What is R!

The R project is a huge open source software collaboration. There is a foundation team of 36 people, and contributions from thousands of people globally. You can learn more about the project by visiting this web site [https://www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org).

R is the language of data analysis! It is the top program used for data science today, one of the most powerful tools available, and completely free for anyone to use. 

RStudio is commercial product, but it is free to most of us, and it provides an interface to help us use the R language. 

*If R is the airplane, RStudio is the airport terminal that provides the support.*

## Start coding!

The RStudio window has mutiple panes.

- *Console*: you can type R commands and see output
- *Help*: find out information about functions and packages. This same panel will have tabs for *showing plots* that you make, *view apps* and documents, show *files* in the folder, and *packages* used. 
- *Environment*: lists the objects that you create, such as data sets.
- *Editor*: For creating scripts to run in pieces or as a whole (like this document!)

R is a scripting language, which means that it is just like writing an essay, or a math proof. We write a script to do specific tasks, that we can run again and again, or give to someone else to run. 

*Write the R code required to add two plus two (yes, it is as simple as typing `2+2` below:*

```{r two-plus-two, exercise=TRUE}

```

*R is like a big calculator! Try doing other math operations, like subtraction, multiplication, division, or square root and power operations.*

## Quiz

```{r operators}
quiz(
  question("Which symbol/operator is used to indicate raising a number to a power?",
    answer("`+`"),
    answer("`/`"),
    answer("`^`", correct = TRUE),
    answer("`%`")
  ),
  question("If you want to find the remainder of 5 divided by 2, which operator is used?",
    answer("`%%`", correct = TRUE),
    answer("`%/%`"),
    answer("`|`"),
    answer("`*`")
    )
)
```

## Simulation

Let's pretend that we are math teachers and we've just given the class a test. R can be used to simulate results like this. 

- The code `rnorm(35, 70, 10)` will generate a sample of size 35 from a normal model with mean 70 and standard deviation 10. 
- But when you do this you will likely want to save the result into a data object. Lets call this `scores`. 
- To save it you need to assign the result to `scores` using the `gets` operator `<-`. This is just like an `=` sign. 

*Try it, `scores <- rnorm(35, 70, 10)`*

```{r rnorm, exercise=TRUE}

```

Oh, nothing happens! That is because we have saved the result into a data object. Let's check if we have created a dataset. You can check the length of scores using `length(scores)`. It should be 35. You can also compute the mean and standard deviation of the data using `mean(scores)` and `sd(scores)`

## Functions

In math, we use functions all the time. Functions have inputs and outputs, e.g. $f(x) = 3x^2+x+1$

R can be considered to be a functional language. These are functions that we have just used, `rnorm(), mean(), sd()`. 

What does a function in R look like? The polynomial function above would look like this in R:

```
mypolyfn <- function(x) {
  f <- 3*x^2 + x + 1
  return(f)
}
```

It takes `x` as the input, and returns `f` as output. The benefit of functions is that it makes your work more efficient - anything that you need to do again and again, or on different sets of data, should be programmed into a function.

Try it! Write the function below, so that it is defined. And then test it out by inputting different values of `x`, e.g. `mypolyfn(2)`, or `mypolyfn(-1)`, or even entering a vector of `x`'s, `mypolyfn(seq(-5, 5, 1))`

```{r functions, exercise=TRUE}

```

What can go wrong?

This function is expecting `x` to be a number. If the user inputs something other that a number, what happens? 

Try it! Try running your function with a text string of your team name instead of a number, e.g. `mypolyfn("numbat")`.

You get an error. Well-written functions check for silly user errors. A better version of the function would be:

```
mypolyfn <- function(x) {
  stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
  f <- 3*x^2 + x + 1
  return(f)
}
```

## YOUR TURN

With your team, experiment with writing functions, in your R Studio Window. Try to write function that simulates a sample of size $n$ from a normal model, allowing the user to input the population mean and standard deviation. The retun values form the function should be the mean and standard deviation of the sample.

## Data frames, tibbles, matrices, vectors

The strength of R is the contribution from people globally, in the form of packages. One of the most used suite of packages is called the `tidyverse`. It has many really easy to use, and nicely contructed functions for reading data, organising data into a format that can be plotted, modelled and analysed. 

To use a package you load the library:

```
library(tidyverse)
```

If you get an error when you load a library, then your version of R on your computer doesn't yet have that package. So you would need to install it using `install.packages("tidyverse")`. You would install once, but load the library every time you start R when you want to use it. WE DON'T NEED TO INSTALL ANY PACKAGES TODAY, EVERYTHING HAS BEEN PRE-INSTALLED. 

Let's take a look at the `tidyverse` package. (It has these packages, `ggplot2`, `tibble`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `purrr`, `dplyr` that will be all loaded when `tidyverse` is loaded.) Load the `tidyverse` library:

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data(diamonds)
diamonds
```

The diamonds data of the data sets provided with the tidyverse to help you learn R. It contains measurements on 50000 diamonds, from a large database of sales. There are 10 variables. Look at the top of overview of the data provided, and you will see the variable labels, and a short-hand description of the type of variable is in the column: `dbl` means numeric, high precision; `ord` is an ordered categorical variable; `int` is a numeric that takes only integer values. Other types possible include `chr` is a text or categorical variable, `fctr` a special type of categorical variable with labels, `date` contains a date, and `lgl` means logical (TRUE or FALSE). 

## Quiz

Look at the data summary and answer these questions:

```{r datatypes}
quiz(
  question("What type of variable is carat?",
    answer("dbl", correct = TRUE),
    answer("int"),
    answer("ord"),
    answer("chr")
  ),
  question("What type of variable is cut?",
    answer("dbl"),
    answer("int"),
    answer("ord"),
    answer("chr", correct = TRUE)
    ),
  question("What type of variable is x?",
    answer("dbl", correct = TRUE),
    answer("int"),
    answer("ord"),
    answer("chr")
    )
)
```

## Back to tibbles and matrices

The whole data set, diamonds is what the tidyverse calls a `tibble`. Tibble is a play on the word table! But it means data in a rectangular format, where there may be different types of variables (numeric, categorical, dates, ...) in different columns. A tibble is a special case of a `data.frame`. You can check the type of data object with a query:

```{r echo=TRUE}
is_tibble(diamonds)
is.data.frame(diamonds)
is.matrix(diamonds)
```

*Aside: The tidyverse tends to use `_` in its function names. Older parts of R tend to use `.` to separate words in function names.*

So diamonds is a tibble and a data.frame, but it is not a matrix. 

When you simulated the sample from a normal model, 

```{r echo=TRUE}
x <- rnorm(100)
is_tibble(x)
is.data.frame(x)
is.matrix(x)
is.vector(x)
```

you created a `vector`. A vector is a column of numbers, and a `matrix` is a rectangular format of data, like a tibble, it has variables in columns, but it can only contain numeric values. 

Knowing the data type, is important because some functions expect one sort of data and can throw an error if it gets something different. You can convert data objects between types. 

A good resource on learning more about the `tidyverse` is the book "R for Data Science" by Garret Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. [You can read it free online.](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

## YOUR TURN: Tidy data verbs

With your group read sections 12.1-12.3 of [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). Then answer these questions:

```{r tidydata}
quiz(
  question("What the three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy?",
    answer("Each variable must have its own column.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Each observation must have its own row.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Each value must have its own cell.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("None of these")
  ),
  question("A common problem is a dataset where some of the column names are not names of variables, but values of a variable. What verb does an action which organises those columns into a new pair of variables?",
    answer("gather", correct = TRUE),
    answer("spread"),
    answer("mutate"),
    answer("select")
    ),
  question("What verb does the opposite to gather?",
    answer("gather"),
    answer("spread", correct = TRUE),
    answer("mutate"),
    answer("select")
    ) 
)
```

## Wrangling verbs

The vast majority of data cleaning tasks can be handled with five verbs:

- `filter()` Pick observations by their values.
- `arrange()` Reorder the rows.
- `select()` Pick variables by their names.
- `mutate()` Create new variables with functions of existing variables.
- `summarise()` Collapse many values down to a single summary.

Oh, and if you use the pipe, `%>%`, you can string several of these actions together to make a data pipeline.

## Filter

Filter is used to pick some cases or observations in the data. Here's an example for the diamonds data. We will choose just diamonds with a `Fair` cut. And to save printing all this to screen, we will check how many diamonds fall into this group.

```{r}
diamonds %>% filter(cut == "Fair") %>% tally()
```

*Try it!* Do these exercises:

- Filter the diamonds data to pick only diamonds that cost less than $400
- Filter diamonds with a Fair cut and cost less than $400
- Filter the diamonds that have cut "Fair" or "Good" (HINT: You need to use the operator `%in%` like this `%in% c("Fair","Good"))`

```{r filter, exercise=TRUE}

```

## Select

Select is used to pick some variables in the data. Here's an example for the diamonds data. We will select just the variables carat and price, thinking that we might make a model for price built on the size of the diamond.

```{r}
diamonds %>% select(carat, price) 
```

*Try it!* Select the variables `x`, `y`, `z`


```{r select, exercise=TRUE}

```

## Arrange

Arrange sorts the data by values in one of the columns. Here's an example which also involves selecting a subset of variables.


```{r}
diamonds %>% select(carat, price) %>%
  arrange(desc(price))
```

Note that `desc` arranges in descending order. 

*Try it!* Arrange carat by price, in increasing order.


```{r arrange, exercise=TRUE}

```

Arrange is mostly used to get quick views of the numbers.

## Mutate

I love the name mutate! It means to create new variables, or modify existing ones. For the diamonds, we might be interested in examining the price per carat of a diamond. Here's how we can create this variable:

```{r}
diamonds %>% mutate(ppc = price/carat)
```

*Try it!* Compute a new variable called size, based on a volume as measured by `x`, `y`, `z`. Is it the same or different from carat?


```{r mutate, exercise=TRUE}

```

## Grammar of graphics

## YOUR TURN: PISA data

Every three years the OECD conducts tests of workforce readiness on around 500,000 15 year olds world wide. The last test's were done in 2015, and the next will be conducted next year. Details about the tests can be found by going to the [OECD PISA website](http://www.oecd.org/pisa). 

*If you click on the `PISA Test` link you will be able to test out your skills. Try it!* 

*How well did you do?*

## Student results

The data from the 2015 results can be downloaded from the `Data` [link](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2015database/). There are multiple data sets, but the one that we will use for this workshop is the student database. We have downloaded this data, and extracted the results for Australia, for you, so you don't need to do this. But you need to understand what is in the database. The student database has test scores for 14,530 Australian 15 year olds. The students were tested on math, science and reading, and there were special topics in science that were tested in that year. In addition, students completed a survey to provide information on their household (how many TVs, books, ...), their gender, and birth year, how supportive their parents are, what their friends like to do, how much time do they spend studying out of hours, and about their attitudes to school, subjects, and teachers. Overall, there are 921 variables!! In the subset we have made there are 44 of these variables. 

Other tables available to download contain survey responses to questionnaires provided to the school principal, and sent home to parents. We won't be working with this information today.

```{r pisa}
quiz(
  question("What age are the students that take the test?",
    answer("12"),
    answer("15", correct = TRUE),
    answer("18"),
    answer("21")
  ),
  question("How many students in Australia were tested in 2015",
    answer("530"),
    answer("1,453"),
    answer("14,530", correct = TRUE),
    answer("145,300")
    ),
  question("What subjects are tested?",
    answer("math", correct = TRUE),
    answer("science", correct = TRUE),
    answer("reading", correct = TRUE),
    answer("writing")
    ) 
)
```

## Building a web story with interactive graphics

## Goal for the day

*The task for the rest of the day is to enhance the app that we have started. Add more features, change the plots, add more data, ... the choice is up to you. Come up with something that you think your friends, teachers or parents might like to explore.*

At the end of the day, we will have presentations from each group about your app.
